<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project



Astral is a robust system designed to support an intergalactic trading network, specifically engineered to manage trade transactions, space cargo, and space station inventory.

* Trade Transactions: Facilitate and manage trade activities between different space entities, ensuring secure and accurate transaction processing.
* Space Cargo Management: Track and manage cargo shipments across the galaxy, providing real-time status updates and handling logistics efficiently.
* Inventory Tracking: Maintain and monitor inventory levels at various space stations, ensuring accurate stock levels and availability.
* Real-Time Updates: Deliver instant updates on trade activities, cargo movements, and inventory changes to keep all network participants informed.



It is Capable of processing large volumes of data seamlessly, ensuring smooth operation even during peak times.


### Built With

The webservice was built with mainly the following Frameworks/Libraries at the core of it keeping it alive

## Design Decision and Architechtural Considerations



For the "Intergalactic Trading Network" project, we utilize the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture with an emphasis on routing instead of a traditional view layer. This design pattern helps in separating the application into distinct components and enhances modularity

* Model - The Model manages the application's data and schema. It responds to requests from the controller to perform data operations and ensure data integrity. It handles business logic and interacts with the database.
* Router - The Router is responsible for defining the application's endpoints and handling incoming requests. It directs the requests to the appropriate controller methods. The router acts as the interface through which different routes are managed and API endpoints are exposed.
* Controller - The Controller processes user requests and interacts with the model to fetch or update data. It is the intermediary that handles the application's logic, processes requests, and sends responses. The controller ensures that the applicationâ€™s functionality is properly executed and that data flows seamlessly between the model and the router.

<h3> Tech Stack</h3>

* Node.js: I chose Node.js because it is a powerful runtime environment that allows JavaScript to run on the server side. It is known for its speed and scalability, making it an excellent choice for building RESTful APIs and handling asynchronous operations efficiently.
* Express.js: I selected Express.js for its simplicity and performance as a web framework for Node.js. It streamlines the development of RESTful APIs with its minimalist and unopinionated approach, allowing for quick and flexible server-side development.
* MongoDB: I opted for MongoDB due to its NoSQL architecture, which is ideal for handling high-throughput and high-volume data. Its horizontal scalability and real-time data processing capabilities make it particularly suited for applications that require efficient data management and real-time updates.
* Socket.io: I incorporated Socket.io to enable real-time, bidirectional, and event-based communication. This library is perfect for developing real-time features such as live chat, real-time analytics, and interactive applications, enhancing the interactivity and responsiveness of the system.

<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

<h2> Prerequisites</h2>

1. Node.Js
2. Package manager of your choice (mpn, yarn etc.)
3. MongoDB
4. socket.io
5. Javascript

<h2> Installation </h2>

1. Clone the repo
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory
   ```sh
   cd <directory name>
3. Install the dependencies
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
4. Create a .env file in the root directory and add the following environment variables. 
   ```py
    MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/your_database_name
    REDIS_URI=redis://localhost:6379
    JWT_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```
5. Start the server
   ```py
   npm run dev (in dev)
   npm start (prod)
   ```
   
6. The server should now be running on your locahost port.

7. You can now test the API using Postman or any other API testing tool.
